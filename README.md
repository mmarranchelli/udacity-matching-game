# Udacity Project - Matching Game

This memory game has been created as a project for the second section of the front end developer nanodegree.

## Getting Started

You can download or clone the files and run it on your local machine or on a web server.

### How to play the game

The game consists of 16 cards, whereby always two cards have the same symbol. You can always reveal two cards. If two identical cards are revealed, the cards remain face up. When all cards have been revealed, the game is over. The goal is to use as few moves as possible. Up to 10 moves, the player gets three stars, until 20 moves he gets two stars, until 30 moves he gets a star. For over 30 moves, the player does not receive stars. As soon as the first card is woken up, a timer starts, which records the required time. Have fun!
